# Nashira Deer // Contributing

If you want to contribute to this project, you can create your fork or branch (following the standards and conventions listed below), make the changes you want and then create a Pull Request for the 'dev' branch.

If you want to contribute with translations, you can edit the files found on `assets/langs` path, they are named using the [Discord's language code](https://discord.com/developers/docs/reference#locales) with `.json` on the end. Just copy the `en-US.json` file and modify your content, remembering that the words involved in {} are variables replaced at runtime, so they should not be translated, you can use the `pt-BR.json`, `de.json` and `es-ES.json` files as example.
